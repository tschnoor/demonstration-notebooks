# demonstration-notebooks
The goal is for this repository to contain Jupyter Notebooks that summarize and illustrate the key points of foundational texts. I will start with the readings assigned as part of my SLHS 900 class, which is focused on LPC formant analysis and other related topics.
## Format
The plan is to have one notebook for each paper I read. Each notebook will contain reference material for the original text (term definitions, copied passages, notes, etc.). Each notebook is also likely to contain some technical demonstration written in Julia.
Additionally, I plan to make a notebook that contains code for conducting LPC analysis. This LPC notebook will serve as the "end-product" of SLHS 900.
I will likely add more notebooks as I see fit.
