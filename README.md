# demonstration-notebooks
The goal is for this repository to contain Jupyter Notebooks that are motivated by one or both of the following goals:
1. to summarize and illustrate the key points of certain foundational texts with a mix of notes and technical demonstration
    - these will be named using the format `<FIRST WORD OF TITLE>_<FIRST AUTHOR NAME>_<PUBLICATION YEAR>.ipynb` 
2. to create a codebase for completing a specific task with demonstration throughout
I will start with the readings assigned as part of my SLHS 900 class, which is focused on LPC formant analysis and other related topics.
## Format
The plan is to have one notebook for each paper I read. Each notebook will contain reference material for the original text (term definitions, copied passages, notes, etc.). Each notebook is also likely to contain some technical demonstration written in Julia.\
Additionally, I plan to make a notebook that contains code for conducting LPC analysis. This LPC notebook will serve as the "end-product" of SLHS 900.\
I will likely add more notebooks as I see fit.
