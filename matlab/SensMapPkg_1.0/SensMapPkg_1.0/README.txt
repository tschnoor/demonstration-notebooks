"SensMap" is a Matlab version of the area function tuning algorithm reported in 
Story, B. H., (2006). A technique for ``tuning'' vocal tract area functions based on acoustic sensitivity functions,
 J. Acoust. Soc. Am., 119(2), 715-718.

There are two scripts called TestCase_a.m and TestCase_i.m that 
can be run from the Matlab prompt - i.e.,

>>TestCase_i

This will run a test case of perturbing an initial area function into one that is /i/-like. The other test case will 
generate an /a/-like area function.

Looking through the test case script will give you an idea about how the code runs.

Note: the test cases will take about 5 to 10 seconds to run
